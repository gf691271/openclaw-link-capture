# link-capture requirements
# All fetchers use stdlib except YouTube which needs system tools

# Optional: faster web scraping (falls back to stdlib urllib if not present)
# beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0

# System tools (install via Homebrew or package manager):
#   brew install yt-dlp          # YouTube download
#   brew install openai-whisper  # audio transcription (or: pip install openai-whisper)
#
# No pip packages required for core functionality.
# stdlib only: urllib, json, sqlite3, subprocess, re, hashlib, tempfile
